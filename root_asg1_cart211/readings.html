    <h4>week 2: "as we may think" by vannevar vush</h4>
    <p class="readings">After reading the article, I am really amazed and appreciate that Mr Vannevar Bush wrote this article. The ideas brought up by the Mr Vannevar Bush are very inspiring to me, it makes me think about what should I do in the future and how to break the current limitations to think one step further. Inventions and development of technology and machines are all come from people’s imagination.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">At the beginning of the article, it says, “What are the scientists to do next?” and “as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.” These two lines shows that Mr Bush never satisfied with what he already achieved, I am totally agree to the idea that no matter which field we are working in, we should always look for the goals that allows us to break the past records and makes human lives better.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">I feel that there is a remarkable progression between the past and now in terms of technology. With the effort of the scientists, our daily gadgets can be affordable, interchangeable and reliable. Mr Vannevar Bush was an individual with extraordinary imagination in term of the future mechanisation. I am amazed by all the predictions and ideas that Mr Vannevar Bush mentioned in the articles as those are something that we are actually using everyday nowadays. For instance, he said that, “The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times persent speeds, or more.” and “A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” And in the section 8 of the article, it says, “Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.” The ideas of recording, accessing, storing and sharing information are revolutionary. It’s amazing that the article was written in 1945, the article must be extremely influential for the development of the technology at the time.<p/><br><br><br>
    <h4>week 3: “writing the history of the internet” by roy rosenzweig</h4>
    <p class="readings">After reading the article, I had a better understanding of how the Internet is invented and developed. It had being through a long way, it’s first started from the Advanced Research Projects Agency which was founded by the Department of Defense in the United States as a Plan B. And from there, ARPANET  (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)  was introduced for the purpose of sharing information and computer resources. Followed by the increasing popularity of the Unix operating system and it was totally free, therefore Usenet became popular amongst the graduate students at the time. And then it developed to the Internet that we are using nowadays.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">There are so many people contributed to the creation of the Internet. For example, a British physicist, Donald Davies brought in the idea of “‘packet-switching networks’ which is the core technology of the Internet.” and Bob Taylor’s idea of “that we ought to find a way to connect all these different machines and share extremely expensive computer equipment.” and “In 1967, at a meeting in Ann Arbor, Wes Clark of Washington University came up with the crucial idea of making the network function by inserting a sub-network of smaller computers between the host computers and the network lines—what later came to be called Interface Message Processors, or IMPs.” IMP facilitate the ARPANET and Internet. Not only scientists take part in the development of the Internet, the graduate students popularized the Usenet and brought in the idea of Liberty also played a part.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">There are difference interpretations to the origin of the Internet, the military needs, sharing resources between the scientists. I believe none of them expect that the Internet can be freely used by anyone worldwide. Innovation and development is also based on a needs. Maybe the initial idea behind was different, but we never know what will it be in the future.</p><br><br><br>
