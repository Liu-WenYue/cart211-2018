    <h4>week 2: "as we may think" by vannevar vush</h4>
    <p class="readings">After reading the article, I am really amazed and appreciate that Mr Vannevar Bush wrote this article. The ideas brought up by the Mr Vannevar Bush are very inspiring to me, it makes me think about what should I do in the future and how to break the current limitations to think one step further. Inventions and development of technology and machines are all come from people’s imagination.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">At the beginning of the article, it says, “What are the scientists to do next?” and “as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.” These two lines shows that Mr Bush never satisfied with what he already achieved, I am totally agree to the idea that no matter which field we are working in, we should always look for the goals that allows us to break the past records and makes human lives better.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">I feel that there is a remarkable progression between the past and now in terms of technology. With the effort of the scientists, our daily gadgets can be affordable, interchangeable and reliable. Mr Vannevar Bush was an individual with extraordinary imagination in term of the future mechanisation. I am amazed by all the predictions and ideas that Mr Vannevar Bush mentioned in the articles as those are something that we are actually using everyday nowadays. For instance, he said that, “The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times persent speeds, or more.” and “A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” And in the section 8 of the article, it says, “Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.” The ideas of recording, accessing, storing and sharing information are revolutionary. It’s amazing that the article was written in 1945, the article must be extremely influential for the development of the technology at the time.

    <h4>week 3: “writing the history of the internet” by roy rosenzweig</h4>
    <p class="readings">After reading the article, I had a better understanding of how the Internet is invented and developed. It had being through a long way, it’s first started from the Advanced Research Projects Agency which was founded by the Department of Defense in the United States as a Plan B. And from there, ARPANET  (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)  was introduced for the purpose of sharing information and computer resources. Followed by the increasing popularity of the Unix operating system and it was totally free, therefore Usenet became popular amongst the graduate students at the time. And then it developed to the Internet that we are using nowadays.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">There are so many people contributed to the creation of the Internet. For example, a British physicist, Donald Davies brought in the idea of “‘packet-switching networks’ which is the core technology of the Internet.” and Bob Taylor’s idea of “that we ought to find a way to connect all these different machines and share extremely expensive computer equipment.” and “In 1967, at a meeting in Ann Arbor, Wes Clark of Washington University came up with the crucial idea of making the network function by inserting a sub-network of smaller computers between the host computers and the network lines—what later came to be called Interface Message Processors, or IMPs.” IMP facilitate the ARPANET and Internet. Not only scientists take part in the development of the Internet, the graduate students popularized the Usenet and brought in the idea of Liberty also played a part.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">There are difference interpretations to the origin of the Internet, the military needs, sharing resources between the scientists. I believe none of them expect that the Internet can be freely used by anyone worldwide. Innovation and development is also based on a needs. Maybe the initial idea behind was different, but we never know what will it be in the future.

    <h4>week 5: “Web Work: A History of Internet Art” by Rachel Greene & “The New World of Net Art” by Carolina Miranda</h4>
    <p class="readings">After reading the article, I had a better idea about the history of Internet Art,  how does it develop and how does it benefit artists. In December 1995, Vuk Cosic opened an anonymous email and the content was distorted caused by a software glitch, he used the term NET.ART to describe this. And then, In the 1990s, the term net art started to be known and discussed by people online with The Thing (An electronic bulletin board system). No one at the time knows what the Internet Art is and what it is going to be. As Christiane Paul says, “We are looking at something that is becoming more hybrid. Pieces often have different manifestations: an application, a net-based piece, an installation.” For instance, In 1995, Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans created a website that contains only random characters and symbols, however, there will be shapes and diagrams when the viewers click on the programming code. Moreover, In 2011, a performance piece called Dorm Daze was staged and carried out on Facebook. The Internet allowed the artists to do whatever they like to try.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">As Rachel Greene said in the article, “it was artists, enthusiasts, and technoculture critics trading ideas, sustaining one another’s interest through ongoing dialogue.” I believe all the people back then will definitely take the challenge to produce something based on this new medium even if they know nothing about the Internet or art. Because of the unknown possibility of the mixture between Internet and art, the artists, programmers, and creators can all open their mind and do whatever experiment they want.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">The Internet environment was also great for them to focus on their ideas and get inspired by other artists online. In the article Web Work: A History of Internet Art, it says, “In the years between 1994 and 1998, when many of the extant art-oriented communities formed.” and “The online atmosphere was lively and gregarious, and there was an eager audience for net.art.” The working environment plays a very important part in producing innovative works. The good environment allows them to exchange ideas with other artists and get encouraged by their audiences.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">The internet not only giving artists a new medium for them to explore, but a broader platform for them to showcase and probably sell their artworks. In a project called “The Shortest Video Art Ever Sold”, there are various artists created twenty-two different short videos using Vine, one of the pieces sold to a Dutch curator at $200.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">The Internet creates an amazing environment for people who are interested in creating and developing internet art. Today, there are so many amazing design software for us to create artworks digitally, so many websites and social media platforms to get inspired and showcase our works. I believe the current generation should also take the challenge to do something that is innovative and meaningful.

    <h4>week 6:“The GNU Manifesto” by Stallman</h4>
    <p class="readings">In 1982, A.T.& T. was closed down and they stopped sharing Unix source code and there were many programmers are unhappy with the commercialization of system software. Richard Stallman started the GNU project, which the main purpose is to create a totally free operating system and to ask support in developing the GNU operating system. Although GNU is similar to Unix but with more features and GNU is able to run Unix programs.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">I think it was smart to make GNU compatible with Unix, as Unix operating system is the most commonly used operating system at the time, people will be more willing to use an operating system that they were familiar with. And if some of the users are still using the Unix operating system, they will still be able to use GNU software.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">As Stallman said in the article, “I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it.” I totally agree with him on the topic of sharing. I believe sharing make ourselves a better person and it will definitely improve our work.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">The GNU operating system is free for all the users to use. Stallman said, “GNU is not in the public domain. Everyone will be permitted to modify and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its further redistribution. That is to say, proprietary modification will not be allowed. I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain free.” What Stallman did was beneficial for all the computer users. No matter which field we are working in, I deeply believe that we should all be doing things that make humanity better. People should be allowed to make modifications of the past works as long as it really improved the past work and not just simply copying.

    <h4>week 8:“Mind vs. Machine” by Brian Christian</h4>
    <p class="readings">This article told us about the development of artificial intelligence and how the author felt about the development that changes our life and questioning what a real human is. Mr. Brian brought in the example of the Turing Test, which humans have to compete with computers to see who is more like to be the actual “human”. It sounds weird, but if we think deeply it actually has a profound meaning in it, as Mr. Brian questioned in the article, “how, in fact, do we be the most human we can be - not only under the constraints of the test,  but in life?” What is a real human? How to be a real human? What is that makes us human? Mr. Brian also stated his opinion in the article, “What is the process by which someone enters into our life and comes to mean something to us? These, to me, are the test’s most central questions—the most central questions of being human.” I totally agree with Mr. Brian, we are all individuals, only when someone comes into our life we can use languages, exchange ideas and knowledge, make decisions and create memories. All these distinctive activities with other people make us human.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">In my opinion, I feel the artificial intelligence that people developed nowadays are still build from the bottom up which means it’s based on past experience and data, they are not capable of making their own decisions. Machines can be an assets for us, but human definitely needs to be equipped with the knowledge as well. For instance, if machines are used in operation and it goes out of control for some reason, there have to be someone can carry on the operation. We, humans, cannot fully rely on machines.</p><br>
    <p class="readings">Machines can be very helpful if we use them wisely, the only thing that makes human scared is that maybe one day machine may go out of human’s control.
